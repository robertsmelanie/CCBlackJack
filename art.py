# Set the logo fro this game to the variable "logo", logo artwork comes from ascii.co.uk

# For this we will use three quotation marks, """ """, this is a DOCSTRING, or Documentation String. Python docstrings are strings used right after the definition of a function, method, class, or module
# Docstrings are different from comments, so while this appears to be a multiline or block comment it is not best practice to use it for the purpose 
# For multiline comments, continue using the '#' on each line
